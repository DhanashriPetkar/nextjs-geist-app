Below is the detailed implementation plan that breaks the work into three files—index.html, style.css, and script.js—with step-by-step instructions along with error handling and best practices. This landing page will work as a standalone modern full‐screen page that integrates smooth background animations, special text morph effects, a tagline, and a YouTube URL input section with an interactive button.

---

**1. index.html**

- Create an HTML5 document with a proper DOCTYPE, meta viewport tag, and link to the external style.css and script.js files.  
- In the <head>, import a modern sans-serif font (e.g., “Poppins” or “Montserrat”) using Google Fonts. For example:  
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@400;600&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">  
- In the <body> include:  
  – A full-screen container (e.g., a <div id="background"> or simply apply the animation to the body) for the subtle animated background (gradient shimmer or slow-moving abstract pattern using CSS keyframes).  
  – A central section (<section class="hero">) containing an <h1> with the text “Scroll Good”. Split the text so that the last letter of “Scroll” is wrapped in a span (class="morph") and similarly wrap the final “d” of “Good” inside a target span (<span class="morph-target">) that is initially hidden.  
  – A tagline element (<p class="tagline">your feed, your control</p>) placed below the main heading that will fade in upward after the main text animation.  
  – A bottom section (<div class="youtube-section">) with:
   - An input area inside a full-width grey bar. Use an <input type="text" class="youtube-input" placeholder="paste your YouTube link here"> so the text appears in bold white on a light-grey background.
   - A button (<button class="submit-btn" aria-label="Submit YouTube Link">) containing a simple Unicode right arrow (→) as text.  
- Ensure semantic structure and add proper alt texts if any images are added (using placeholder URLs only when explicitly required).

**2. style.css**

- Reset and set global styles (box-sizing, margins, padding) and apply a black background.  
- Set the imported font-family for body, headers, and inputs.  
- Create keyframes for:
  – Background animation (e.g., a slowly sliding linear-gradient or an abstract shape using CSS animations).
  – Main text entrance (using a combination of zoom-in and fade rather than a letter-by-letter reveal for simplicity).  
  – The morph animation on the “morph” span so that its transform scales vertically with a downward translation. Also, add a fade-out transition of the original “l” and a simultaneous fade-in of the “morph-target” letter in “Good”.
  – Tagline’s fade-in-up effect.
  – Button hover effects (e.g., slight background color change and a subtle arrow translation or scale effect).
- Style the input so that it uses a light grey background, bold white text, and is fully responsive with proper padding and border radius.  
- Use media queries to adjust font sizes and spacing for mobile devices.

**3. script.js**

- Wrap all JS code in a DOMContentLoaded listener to ensure elements are loaded before binding event listeners.  
- Select the YouTube input and button elements; on button click, capture the value from the input.  
- Validate the input (e.g., check for an empty string) and log the URL into the console.  
- Optionally, add error handling (a try–catch block) in case the querySelector fails or the input is invalid.  
- Keep the JavaScript minimal for this interactive functionality while relying on CSS for the heavy lifting of animations.

**Integration & Best Practices**

- All new files are self-contained; they do not interfere with Next.js-specific files because they can be deployed as a static landing page.  
- Confirm that proper semantic HTML (section, header) is used and that accessibility attributes (aria-labels on the button) are in place.  
- The animations leverage CSS keyframes for smooth, looping transitions with fallback mechanisms (e.g., graceful degradation in browsers that do not support advanced CSS animations).  
- The responsive design is ensured using proper viewport settings and media queries in CSS.  
- Error handling in script.js ensures that if the input field is missing or empty, a message is printed to the console.

**Summary**

- The index.html file sets up a semantic structure with a full-screen animated background, a hero section for the “Scroll Good” text (including a morph effect), a tagline, and a YouTube input section with a submit button.  
- The style.css file includes global resets, font integration, keyframe animations (background, entrance, morph, and button hover), and responsive styles with media queries.  
- The script.js file adds interactivity by capturing and logging the YouTube URL upon button click, wrapped in DOMContentLoaded for reliability.  
- Best practices include semantic markup, accessibility features, error handling, and a fully responsive modern design.  
- This plan ensures that every dependent file is addressed and integrated according to real-world design and functionality requirements without using external icon libraries.
